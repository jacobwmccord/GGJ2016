The year is divisible by four -- and now, more than ever, is it essential that our party chooses the best candidate for upcoming presidential election. In the natural seclusion of the California woods, four lucky candidates will compete in a final debate to decide, once and for all, who will be the next nominee of the GOP.

The debate will consist of three rounds. Each candidate must answer the question provided by the giant, looming statue of Ronald Reagan, blessed be his name. Throughout the debate, the audience will be voting for their favorite candidate, so our debaters will need to cater their answers to the needs and wants of their audience. 

After each round, the candidate with the lowest points will be ritually sacrificed and melted in a boiling concoction. At the end of the debate, the winning candidate will drink the essence of his three slain opponents, so that he may be imbued with the Power of the Elephant. 

Sure, it’s blatantly corrupt. But it works.
